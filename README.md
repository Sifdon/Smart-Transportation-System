# Smart-Transportation-System
A solution to fasten the vehicle checking process and identifying unlicensed vehicles and levying appropriate fines accordingly in real-time by the traffic police. Validation of user's credentials was done using RFID readers supported by Raspberry-pi at frontend and Firebase cloud at backend.

The purpose of this project is to implement smart and efficient credential verification using a raspberry pi and RFIDs. Data will be fetched from cloud in real time to the android application which enables secure and accurate data. The government can keep track of the uninsured and unregistered vehicles in the state or country in real time which will help them devise better strategies to curb them. This system eliminates manual verification which has a high chance of discrepancies and facilitates an easy way for the citizens to check their fine dues.
